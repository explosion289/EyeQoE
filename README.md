# EyeQoE

50 volunteers each invited to watch 70 videos.
The video set includes 10 source videos of different quality versions, i.e., 720 p, 1080 p, 2K, 8 stalls, 4 stalls, 2 stalls, and original.
Each trace file corresponds to one video play with 5000 timestamps (25 s * 200 Hz) and contains raw data collected by the eye tracker.
Raw data include: timestamp, head rotation (pitch, yaw, and roll) , gaze position (x and y), pupil diameter, eye openness (1 = open vs 0 = closed), gaze vergence distance (GVD), and action (1 = fixation vs 0 = saccade).
The user-rated QoE label (1-5), together with video quality version and subjective factors, i.e., cybersickness, fatigue, and immersiveness, are also presented in each trace file to describe the video.
